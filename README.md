# redis for Storyscript
This container should be used for connecting to a hosted Redis server. It does not come bundled with its own Redis server.

#### Example

```coffee
# Storyscript
value = redis set key: "hello" value: "world"
value = redis get key: "hello"
value = redis del key: "hello"
value = redis lpush key: "hello" value: "world1"
value = redis rpush key: "hello" value: "world2"
value = redis lpop key: "hello"
value = redis rpop key: "hello"

# Streaming example
redis listener as rds
  when rds rpop key: 'foo' as event  # Can also lpop.
    # Do something with event...
```
